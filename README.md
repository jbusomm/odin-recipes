# odin-recipes

This project focuses on the basics of HTML and putting them to work with a simple recipe webpage with links to other webpages within the project.

I've found this project to be fairly easy when you get in the flow of html. Even though I found this project to be on the easier side, I still found some small problems:

Problems that I found but solved:
    路 Making the image smaller within the same ratio (so it didn't look stretched)
    路 Getting the "return to..." buttons (using ".." so it knew where to find the other pages)
    路 Unordered list "dots" being off centered (it was outside <body> tag)

Problems that I found but I didn't solve:
    路 Having to use multiple paragraphs so descriptions didn't look like a long sentence.
        I temporarily fixed this by using multiple <p> tags, but since they're supposed to be paragraphs, there are small spaces between them, which they don't look to visually appealing.
    My thoughts on not fixing this, is that it's probably done on CSS, I didn't feel like it was something that I should be worrying about right now. I worked with what I had so I could get close to my vision.
