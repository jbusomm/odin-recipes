    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crema Catalana is Spain's version of creme brûlée. Or, as many Catalans would argue, creme brûlée is France's version of Crema Catalana!</p>
        <p>Crema Catalana is made with milk instead of cream, and often incorporates lemon peel and cinnamon. It's also not made using a bain-marie (a water bath, or baño maría in Spanish), which means it's easier to make than its French cousin. I guarantee you, it is to die for when made well!</p>
        <p>This Crema Catalana recipe is adapted from Claudia Roden's The Food of Spain-- one of my favorite Spanish cookbooks.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Citrus peel</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Egg yolks</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the milk, citrus peels, and cinnamon stick until it begins to simmer, then remove it from the heat.</li>
            <li>Dissolve the cornstarch in a splash of water to make a slurry.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar to the egg yolks.</li>
            <li>Whisk vigorously until the mixture is pale yellow</li>
            <li>Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the egg yolk mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour in a splash of the warm milk, whisking constantly.</li>
            <li>Remove the citrus peels and cinnamon stick from the milk.</li>
            <li>Slowly whisk in the egg mixture, whisking constantly so that the eggs don't scramble.</li>
            <li>Keep whisking the mixture over a low heat until it thickens to a pudding-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Pour into ramekins or traditional clay dishes.</li>
            <li>Cover each serving with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic onto the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for 4 hours, or preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic and sprinkle a layer of sugar on top of each custard.</li>
            <li>Get out your blowtorch (or a traditional iron rod like in Catalonia) and burn the sugar until caramelized. Some people prefer a darker crust, others lighter -- it's up to you!</li>
